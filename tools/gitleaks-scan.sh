# Scan this repository's git history for leaked credentials.
#
# Two things happen here, and the second is the more important one:
#
# 1. gitleaks scans every commit reachable from HEAD -- which on a pull
#    request means the whole of develop plus the branch under test --
#    and the script fails if anything is found.
#
# 2. A positive control proves the scanner can still fire. A detector
#    which reports nothing is indistinguishable from a detector which is
#    broken -- a bad config, a shallow clone, an allowlist which grew
#    until it forgave everything. So we plant a credential in a scratch
#    directory and fail if gitleaks does not report it. Green here means
#    "scanned and found nothing", not "did nothing".
#
# There is no .gitleaks.toml. This client mints no credential of its
# own, so there is no project-specific rule to add and nothing yet to
# allowlist; gitleaks' default ruleset is the whole configuration. If a
# finding ever needs accepting, read the "Accepting a finding" section
# of development/docs/audits/secret-handling.md first -- the choice
# between an allowlist regex and a .gitleaksignore fingerprint is not
# a matter of taste.
#
# Reachability from HEAD, rather than gitleaks' default of every ref, is
# deliberate: scanning every ref is not what anyone means by "scan this
# project's history", and gitleaks 8.16 misattributes the findings it
# produces that way to unrelated merge commits, so they cannot be
# triaged by commit either. On a pull request HEAD reaches the branch
# under test and all of the default branch, so nothing is given up.
#
# The version this was written and tested against is 8.16.0, which is
# what Debian 13 packages and therefore what secret-scan.yml installs.
# Newer 8.x releases supersede `detect` with `gitleaks git` and
# `gitleaks dir`; 8.16 has neither, so `detect` is not merely the older
# spelling here, it is the only one. When the packaged version moves,
# the positive control below is what will notice.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/gitleaks-scan.sh [--gitleaks PATH]
#
# Runs from anywhere inside the working tree -- it changes to the top
# itself -- but the clone must be a full one, not shallow.
